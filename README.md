- 👋 Hi, I’m @JDS150k
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, interactive fiction, choice-based games, web-based virtual worlds, narratology, fractal geometry, and personal development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use the Flask framework to make web apps with Python, SQLite3, HTML5, CSS, SASS, and Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will challenge me to improve myself, especially if it is a narrative-driven or narrative-orientated project.
- 📫 How to reach me: discord (JDS#9514) or email (jds150k@gmail.com).
